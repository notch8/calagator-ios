Calagator IOS App
===================

Portland, Oregon's Mobile technology Calendar
--------------------------------------------

Calagator is The tech calendar for meetups, events, and happenings around the Portland area having to do with technology.  The [online calendar](http://calagator.org) and the app are free to use and add your own events.  You are warmly encouraged to get involved in developing both this IOS app, and the [calagator.org](https://github.com/calagator/calagator) site itself, which is a [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org) site.  This app was build on the most excellent [Ruby Motion](http://rubymotion.com) platform.  Experienced, and developers gaining experience are equally welcome here.  You will learn a lot, and you can contribute a lot.  This code is all open source, a great resume builder, and your code will benefit many thousands of Portland technologists who rely on Calagator to stay connected.  Strangers will thank you and buy you beer, and you really will be almost as awesome, but not quite as awesome as your dog/cat/chinchilla thinks that you are.
